      <p>Dear {{ firstname }} {{ lastname }},</p>

      <p>
        Thank you for your order of {{ quantity }} flats of
        {{ melontype }} melons.
      </p>

      <p>
        {% if time=='am' %}
          We will arrive promptly at 2 in the morning with your
          melons. Please have coffee prepared for our delivery person.
        {% elif time=='pm' %}
          We will shuffle over sometime just before midnight. Make
          sure to leave a porch light on.
        {% elif time=='wat' %}
          We will arrive during a leapsecond and leave via a magical unicorn.
        {% else %}
          We didn't understand your delivery time request, though.
        {% endif %}
      </p>

      <p>
        {% if returning %}
          We're always delighted to work with returning customers like
          yourself.
        {% else %}
          Of course, we are curious why you've never ordered from us before.
          You're not a Squiysh employee, are you?!
        {% endif %}
      </p>

      <p>We take special pride in our outreach to the {{ stats }}
        community.</p>

      <p>
        As you ordered {{ quantity }} flats, at our per-pound price,
        your total will be $1,042,042.
      </p>

      <p>Thank you!</p>

      <p>Jenny &ldquo;Seedless&rdquo; Jefferson,<br>Sales Manager</p>
